        <p>India is a country located in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest democracy in the world, and it is bordered by Pakistan, China, Nepal, and Bangladesh. It is also the region's most populous country.
            In the Indian Ocean, it is bordered by the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Its Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located in the region's maritime border with Indonesia and Thailand.
            Modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent around 55,000 years ago from Africa. The region is second only to Africa in terms of human genetic diversity. Settled life began in the western part of the Indus river basin around 9,000 years ago.
            Around 1,200 BCE, the language of Sanskrit was brought into India from the northwest. The Dravidian languages were then supplanted, and various social orders were declared unlinked to heredity.
            The Vijayanagara Empire established a long-lasting Hindu culture in south India. By the 15th century, the rise of Sikhism was followed by the formation of a new religion in the province of Punjab.
            The British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights granted to Indians were slowly granted, but various changes were made to the public life. A nationalist movement emerged which would become the driving force behind the end of the British rule.
            In 1947, the British Indian Empire was split into two independent nations, with one being a Hindu-dominated region known as India and the other a Muslim-dominated area known as Pakistan.
            India is a multi-ethnic and pluralistic society governed by a democratic parliamentary system. Its population has grown significantly since 1951, and its per capita income has increased significantly.
            From being a destitute country in 1951 to a major economy with an expanding middle class, India has become a cultural force globally. Its space program is also developing extraterrestrial missions.
            Despite this progress, India still has a high rate of poverty. Its military budget is among the highest in the world, and it has disputes with its neighbours, such as China and Pakistan.
            India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.

        <p>In India, there are 28 states and 8 union territories, all of which have elected legislatures and governments, including Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry, and Delhi.
            These are arranged according to Westminster's system of governance.Five more union territories are governed directly by the central government through appointed administrators.
            States were reorganized on a linguistic basis in 1956 under the States Reorganisation Act. There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at the city, town, block,
            district, and village levels.

                The state was once a major Buddhist pilgrimage site in the country and a Buddhist learning center which can be seen in many sites in the state in the form of monastery ruins, chaityas 
                and stupas. Locally mined diamonds include the Koh-i-Noor from Kollur Mine. The state is also a major producer of rice, known as the "rice bowl of India".Telugu, one of India's classical 
                languages, is the fourth most spoken language in the country and the 11th in the world.

                Arunachal Pradesh, a state in northeastern India, was formed from the erstwhile North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) area. It borders Assam and Nagaland to the south and Bhutan to the west. 
                Myanmar in the east, the McMahon Line in the north and Itanagar is the state capital of Arunachal Pradesh. Arunachal Pradesh is the largest of the Seven Sister States of Northeast India by area. 
                Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,129 km border with China's Tibet Autonomous Region.In 2011, the 2011 Census of India counted 1382,611 people living in Arunachal Pradesh, and its area was 83,743 square 
                kilometers (32,333 square miles). It is a state with a diverse ethnic population, with most of Monpa people in the west, most of Tani people in the middle, most of Mishmi and Tai people in the east.
                About 45 tribes/sub-tribes live in the state. The main tribes of the state are Adi, Nyshi, Galo, Tagin, Apatani, and so forth. The Mishmi tribe has three sub-tribes, namely Idu-Mishmi, Digaru-Mishmi, 
                and Miju-Mishmi.

            <p>
                Assam is a state in northeastern India, south of the eastern Himalayas along the Brahmaputra and Barak River valleys. Assam covers an area of 78,438 km2 (30,285 sq mi). The state is bordered by Bhutan and 
                Arunachal Pradesh to the north; Nagaland and Manipur to the east; Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Bangladesh to the south; and West Bengal to the west via the Siliguri Corridor, a 22 kilometers (14 mi) wide 
                strip of land that connects the state to the rest of India. Assamese is the official and most commonly spoken language of the state, followed by Bengali, which is official in the Barak Valley, and Bodo, which 
                is co-official in Assam and official in Bodoland Territorial Region.  Assam is known for Assam tea and Assam silk. The state was the first site for oil drilling in Asia. Assam is home to the one-horned Indian 
                rhinoceros, along with the wild water buffalo, pygmy hog, tiger and various species of Asian birds, and provides one of the last wild habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife 
                tourism to Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park, which are World Heritage Sites. Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is famed for its feral horses. Sal tree forests are found in the state which, because of 
                abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a hydro-geomorphic 
                environment.

                <h4>4. Bihar</h4>
            </a>
            <img id="Bihar" src="https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/bihar/bihar-map.jpg?v:1.0"> 
            <p> 
                Bihar is a state in eastern India.  It is the third-largest state by population and twelfth-largest by territory, with an area of 94,163 km2 (36,357 sq mi).  Bihar borders Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, 
                the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and with Jharkhand to the south.The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east. Bihar is also the world's fourth-most populous subnational entity.
                On 15 November 2000, southern Bihar was ceded to form the new state of Jharkhand.  Only 11.3% of the population of Bihar lives in urban areas, which is the lowest in India after Himachal Pradesh.  Additionally, almost 58% 
                of Biharis are below the age of 25, giving Bihar the highest proportion of young people of any Indian state. In ancient and classical India, the area that is now Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture. 
                From Magadha arose India's first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world's most widely adhered-to religions: Buddhism.  Magadha empires, notably under the Maurya and Gupta dynasties, unified large parts of South 
                Asia under a central rule. Another reg on of Bihar is Mithila which was an early centre of learning and the centre of the Videha kingdom.Since the late 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in terms of social and 
                economic development. Many economists and social scientists claim that this is a direct result of the policies of the central government, such as the freight equalisation policy, its apathy towards Bihar, lack of Bihari sub-nationalism, 
                and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company. The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state.  Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased 
                investment in infrastructure, better healthcare facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption.

                The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient Avanti Mahajanapada, whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India.  The Maratha Empire dominated the majority of the 18th century.  After the Anglo-Maratha Wars in the 19th century, the region was divided into several 
                princely states under the British and incorporated into Central Provinces and Berar and the Central India Agency. After India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with Nagpur as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra.  In 1956, this state was reorganised and its parts were combined with the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh and Bhopal to form the new 
                Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking Vidarbha region was removed and merged with the Bombay State.

                the Mizos".  Within India's northeast region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh 
                and Myanmar.Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972, when it was carved out as a Union Territory.  In 1986 the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the 
                State of Mizoram on 20 February 1987, as India's 23rd state.

The Andaman Sea lies to the east and 
                the Bay of Bengal to the west.  The island chains are thought to be a submerged extension of the Arakan Mountains.The territory's capital is the city of Port Blair.  The total land area of the islands is approximately 8,249 km2 (3,185 sq mi).  The territory is divided into three districts: the Nicobar
                 District with Car Nicobar as its capital, the South Andaman district with Port Blair as its capital, and the North and Middle Andaman district with Mayabunder as its capital.The islands host the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only tri-service geographical command of the Indian Armed Forces.The Andaman 
                Islands are also home to the Sentinelese people, an uncontacted tribe. The Sentinelese might be the only people currently known to not have reached further than a Paleolithic level of technology; however, this is disputed, as evidence of metalwork was found on their island.

The territory was constituted through the merger of the former territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.  Plans for the proposed merger were announced by the Government of India in July 2019, the necessary legislation
                 was passed in the Parliament of India in December 2019 and came into effect on 26 January 2020. The territory is made up of four separate geographical entities: Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman, and the island of Diu.  All four areas were part of Portuguese Goa and Damaon with the former capital in Panaji, 
                and came under Indian rule in the mid-20th century after the Annexation of Goa.  These were jointly administered as Goa, Daman and Diu until 1987, when Goa was granted statehood after the Konkani language agitation.

                Jammu and Kashmir is a region administered by India as a union territory and consisting of the southern portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947, and between India and China since 1962.  The Line of Control separates Jammu and Kashmir
                 from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north. It lies to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh, which is also subject to the dispute as a part of Kashmir, and administered by India as a union territory.
                 Provisions for the formation of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir were contained within the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which was passed by both houses of the Parliament of India in August 2019. The act re-constituted the former state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories, 
                Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, with effect from 31 October 2019.

It is an archipelago of 36 islands in the Arabian sea, located 200 to 440 km (120 to 270 mi) off the Malabar Coast.The name Lakshadweep means "one lakh islands" in Malayalam, though the Laccadive Islands are just one part of the archipelago of 
                no more than a hundred islands. Malayalam is official as well as the widely spoken native language in the territory.  The islands form the smallest union territory of India and their total surface area is just 32 km2 (12 sq mi).  The lagoon area covers about 4,200 km2 (1,600 sq mi), the territorial waters area 
                20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi) and the exclusive economic zone area 400,000 km2 (150,000 sq mi). The region forms a single Indian district with 10 subdivisions.
